# ZombieGame
A zombie shooting game, each round the difficulty level increases.
The zombies will surprise you!

You can download the "ZombieGame.7z" file and play it on your own PC.

During the project, I used:
- Building environment from the object database.
- Adding invisible walls and limitations.
- Looking around with mouseLook.
- Gravity manually and using layers and masks.
- NavMesh and NavMesh Agent (to allow the zombie to follow).
- Make the enemy run after the player and loop the run animation.
- Creating the player & enemy health that is reduced when Hit.
- Adding a crosshair.
- Adding a recoil animation to the weapon.
- Using Raycasts to shoot.
- Adding spawn locations.
- Displaying the rounds.
- Creating the main menu, game over screen, restarting the game, and replayable.
